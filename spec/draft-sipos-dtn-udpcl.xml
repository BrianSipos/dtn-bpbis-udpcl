This document describes a UDP-based convergence layer (UDPCL) for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).
This version of the UDPCL protocol clarifies requirements of RFC7122, adds discussion of multicast addressing, and updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP) contents, encodings, and convergence layer requirements in BP Version 7.
Specifically, the UDPCL uses CBOR-encoded BPv7 bundles as its service data unit being transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles.
This version of UDPCL also includes security and extensibility mechanisms.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
This document describes the UDP-based convergence-layer protocol for Delay-Tolerant Networking.
Delay-Tolerant Networking is an end-to-end architecture providing communications in and/or through highly stressed environments, including those with intermittent connectivity, long and/or variable delays, and high bit error rates.
More detailed descriptions of the rationale and capabilities of these networks can be found in "Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture" <xref target="RFC4838"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
An important goal of the DTN architecture is to accommodate a wide range of networking technologies and environments.
The protocol used for DTN communications is the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>, an application-layer protocol that is used to construct a store-and-forward overlay network.
BPv7 requires the services of a "convergence-layer adapter" (CLA) to send and receive bundles using the service of some "native" link, network, or Internet protocol.
This document describes one such convergence-layer adapter that uses the well-known User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
This convergence layer is referred to as UDP Convergence Layer (UDPCL).
For the remainder of this document, the abbreviation "BP" without the version suffix refers to BPv7.
      </t>
      <t>
The locations of the UDPCL and the BP in the Internet model protocol stack (described in <xref target="RFC1122"/>) are shown in <xref target="fig-udpcl-ip-stack"/>.
In particular, when BP is using UDP as its bearer with UDPCL as its convergence layer, both BP and UDPCL reside at the application layer of the Internet model.

          <li>
The format of protocol data units of the Bundle Protocol, as those are defined elsewhere in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>.
This includes the concept of bundle fragmentation or bundle encapsulation.
The UDPCL transfers bundles as opaque data blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
Mechanisms for locating or identifying other bundle entities (peers) within a network or across an internet.
The mapping of Node ID to potential convergence layer (CL) protocol and network address is left to implementation and configuration of the BP Agent and its various potential routing strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
Logic for routing bundles along a path toward a bundle's endpoint.
This CL protocol is involved only in transporting bundles between adjacent entities in a routing sequence.
          </li>
          <li>
Logic for performing rate control and congestion control of bundle transfers, both incoming and outgoing from a UDPCL entity.
          </li>
          <li>
Policies or mechanisms for issuing Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) certificates; provisioning, deploying, or accessing certificates and private keys; deploying or accessing certificate revocation lists (CRLs); or configuring security parameters on an individual entity or across a network.
          </li>
          <li>
Uses of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) which are not based on PKIX certificate authentication (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsnopki"/>) or in which authentication of both entities is not possible (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsnoauth"/>).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
Any UDPCL implementation requires a BP agent to perform those above listed functions in order to perform end-to-end bundle delivery.

This is the notional UDPCL application that initiates UDPCL transfers.
This design, implementation, configuration, and specific behavior of such an entity is outside of the scope of this document.
However, the concept of an entity has utility within the scope of this document as the container and initiator of transfers.

            </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
A UDPCL Entity MAY actively perform any number of transfers and should do so whenever the entity has a bundle to forward to another entity in the network.
              </li>
              <li>
A UDPCL Entity MAY support zero or more passive listening elements that listen for transfers from other entities in the network, including non-unicast transfers.

          <dd>
This refers to datagrams exchanged between two network peers, with each peer identified by a (unicast IP address, UDP port) tuple.

      <name>General Protocol Description</name>
      <t>
The service of this protocol is the transmission of DTN bundles via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
This document specifies the optional fragmentation of bundles, procedures for DTLS setup and teardown, and a set of messages and entity requirements.
The general operation of the protocol is as follows.
      </t>
      <t>
Fundamentally, the UDPCL is a (logically) unidirectional "transmit and forget" protocol which itself maintains no long-term state and provides no feedback to the transmitter.
The only long-term state related to UDPCL is used by DTLS in its session keeping (which is bound to a UDP conversation).
An entity receiving a bundle from a particular source address-and-port does not imply that the transmitter is willing to accept bundle transfers on that same address-and-port.
It is the obligation of a BP agent and its routing schemes to determine a bundle return path.
      </t>
      <section anchor="sec-cl-services">
        <name>Convergence Layer Services</name>
        <t>
This version of the UDPCL provides the following services to support the over-laying Bundle Protocol agent.
In all cases, this is not an API definition but a logical description of how the CL can interact with the BP agent.
Each of these interactions can be associated with any number of additional metadata items as necessary to support the operation of the CL or BP agent.
        </t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal">
          <dt>Begin Transmission:</dt>
          <dd>
The principal purpose of the UDPCL is to allow a BP agent to transmit bundle data to one or more other entities.
The receiver of each transfer is identified by an (destination) IPv4 or IPv6 address and a UDP port number (see <xref target="sec-operation"/> for details).
The CL does not necessarily perform any transmission queueing, but may block while transmissions are being processed at the UDP layer.
Any queueing of transmissions is the obligation of the BP agent.
          </dd>
          <dt>Transmission Started:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle transmission begins sending UDP datagrams.
Once started, there is no notion of a UDPCL transmission failure; a BP agent has to rely on bundle-level status reporting to track bundle progress through the network.
Because of potential queueing or DTLS setup time, this may be delayed from the BP agent providing the bundle-to-transmit.
          </dd>
          <dt>Transmission Finished:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle has been fully transmitted.
This is not a positive indication that any next-hop receiver has either received or processed the transfer.
          </dd>
          <dt>Reception Started:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle transfer has begun, which may include information about the total size of a fragmented transfer.
          </dd>
          <dt>Reception Success:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a bundle has been fully transferred from a peer entity.
The transmitter of each transfer is identified by an (source) IP address and a UDP port number (see <xref target="sec-operation"/> for details).
          </dd>
          <dt>Reception Failure:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent on certain reasons for reception failure, notably upon an unfinished transfer timeout (see <xref target="sec-ext-transfer"/>).
          </dd>
          <dt>Attempt DTLS Session:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL allows a BP agent to preemptively attempt to establish a DTLS session with a peer entity (see <xref target="sec-ext-starttls"/> and <xref target="sec-udpcl-security"/>).
Each session attempt can send a different set of session negotiation parameters as directed by the BP agent.
          </dd>
          <dt>Close DTLS Session:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL allows a BP agent to preemptively close an established DTLS session with a peer entity.
The closure request is on a per-session basis.
          </dd>
          <dt>DTLS Session State Changed:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a DTLS session state changes.
The possible DTLS session states are defined in <xref target="RFC6347"/>.
          </dd>
          <dt>Begin Sender Listen:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL allows a BP agent to indicate when packets on a particular address-and-port is listened for (see <xref target="sec-ext-sender-listen"/>).
The Sender Listen interval is configurable for each peer address-and-port.
          </dd>
          <dt>End Sender Listen:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL allows a BP agent to indicate when packets on a particular address-and-port are no longer be accepted.
          </dd>
          <dt>Sender Listen Received:</dt>
          <dd>
The UDPCL entity indicates to the BP agent when a Sender Listen extension has been received from a peer.
The Sender Node ID, if present, is part of this indication.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-pkix-env">
        <name>PKIX Environments and CA Policy</name>
        <t>
This specification gives requirements about how to use PKIX certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA), but does not define any mechanisms for how those certificates come to be.
The UDPCL uses the exact same mechanisms and makes the same assumptions as TCPCL in <xref section="3.4" target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/>.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-policy-fragmentation">
        <name>Fragmentation Policies</name>
        <t>
It is a implementation matter for a sending entity to determine the path maximum transmit unit (PMTU) to be used as a target upper-bound UDP datagram size.
Some techniques to perform MTU discovery are defined in <xref target="RFC8899"/>.
All IP packets sent by a UDPCL entity SHOULD have the "don't fragment" bit set to allow detection of PMTU issues.
        </t>
        <t>
The priority order of fragmentation is the following:
        </t>
        <ol>
          <li>
When possible, bundles too large to fit in one PMTU-sized packet SHOULD be fragmented at the BP layer.
Bundle payload fragmentation does not help a large bundle if extension blocks are a major contributor to bundle size, so in some circumstances BP layer fragmentation will not reduce the bundle size sufficiently.
It is outside the scope of UDPCL to manage BP agent fragmentation policies; bundles are received from the BP agent either already fragmented or not.
          </li>
          <li>
Bundles too large to fit in one PMTU-sized packet SHALL be fragmented as a UDPCL transfer (see <xref target="sec-transfer"/>).
Fragmentation at this level treats bundle transfers as opaque data, so it is independent of bundle block sizes or counts.
          </li>
          <li>
All IP packets larger than expected PMTU SHALL be fragmented by the transmitting entity to fit within one PMTU.
Because of the issues listed in <xref section="3.2" target="RFC8085"/> and <xref target="RFC8900"/>, it is best to avoid IP fragmentation as much as possible.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <t>
A UDPCL entity SHOULD NOT proactively drop an outgoing transfer due to datagram size.
If intermediate network nodes drop IP packets it is an implementation matter to receive network feedback (e.g. ICMP Packet Too Big).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Error Checking Policies</name>
        <t>
The core Bundle Protocol specification assumes that bundles are transferring over an erasure channel, i.e., a channel that either delivers packets correctly or
not at all.
        </t>
        <t>
A UDP transmitter SHALL NOT disable UDP checksums.
A UDP receiver SHALL NOT disable the checking of received UDP checksums.
        </t>
        <t>
Even when UDP checksums are enabled, a small probability of UDP packet corruption remains.
In some environments, it may be acceptable for a BP agent to occasionally receive corrupted input.
In general, however, a UDPCL entity SHOULD insure the a bundle's blocks are either covered by a CRC or a BPSec integrity check.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Congestion Control Policies</name>
        <t>
The applications using UDPCL for bundle transport SHALL conform to the congestion control requirements of <xref section="3.1" target="RFC8085"/>.
The application SHALL either perform active congestion control of bundles or behave as the Low Data-Volume application as defined in <xref section="3.1.3" target="RFC8085"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
When nodes have bidirectional transfer capability, the bundle deletion reason code "traffic pared" can be used by a receiving agent to signal to the bundle source application that throttling of bundles along that path SHOULD occur.

        <t>
The BP agent determines the mapping from destination EID to next-hop CL parameters, including transfer destination address and transfer source interface.
Some EIDs represent unicast destinations and others non-unicast destinations as defined in <xref section="4.2.5.1" target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis"/>.
The unicast-ness of an EID does not necessarily correspond with the unicast-ness, as some bundle routing schemes involve attempting multiple parallel paths to a unicast endpoint.
        </t>
        <t>
For unicast transfers to a single node, the destination address SHALL be a non-multicast IPv4 or IPv6 address (which does include link-local addresses).
For unicast transfers, the source interface address MAY be supplied by the BP agent or otherwise determined by the operating system IP routing.
When performing unicast transfers, a UDPCL entity SHOULD require DTLS use (see <xref target="sec-udpcl-security"/>) or restrict the network to one protected by IPsec or some other under-layer security mechanism (e.g., a virtual private network).
        </t>
        <t>
For multicast transfers to one or more nodes, the destination address SHALL be a multicast IPv4 <xref target="IANA-IPv4-MCAST"/> or IPv6 <xref target="IANA-IPv6-MCAST"/> address.
For multicast transfers, the source interface address MUST be supplied by the BP agent rather than inferred by the UDPCL entity.

Any source port number MAY be used for UDPCL transfers.
Typically an operating system assigned number in the UDP Ephemeral range (49152-65535) is used.
For repeated messaging to the same destination address-and-port, the active entity SHOULD reuse the same source address-and-port.

Each Transfer item contains a Transfer ID which is used to correlate messages for a single bundle transfer.
A Transfer ID does not attempt to address uniqueness of the bundle data itself and has no relation to concepts such as bundle fragmentation.
Each invocation of UDPCL by the BP agent, requesting transmission of a bundle (fragmentary or otherwise), can cause the initiation of a single UDPCL transfer.
          </t>

Because UDPCL operation is connectionless, Transfer IDs from each entity SHALL be unique for the operating duration of the entity.
In practice, the ID needs only be unique for the longest receiver reassembly time window; but because that information is not part of the protocol there is no way for an transmitting entity to know the reassembly time window of any receiver (see <xref target="sec-transfer-fragmentation"/>).
When there are bidirectional bundle transfers between UDPCL entities, an entity SHOULD NOT rely on any relation between Transfer IDs originating from each side of the conversation.

Although there is not a strict requirement for Transfer ID initial values or ordering (see <xref target="sec-security-xferid"/>), in the absence of any other mechanism for generating Transfer IDs an entity SHALL use the following algorithm:
the initial Transfer ID from each entity is zero;
subsequent Transfer ID values are incremented from the prior Transfer ID value by one;

A transmitting entity MAY produce a Transfer with a single fragment (i.e., a Fragment Data size identical to the Total Length).

A transmitting entity SHOULD transmit Transfer fragments in order of Fragment Offset; this makes the behavior deterministic.

Because of the nature of UDP transport, there is no guaranteed order or timing of received Transfer items.
A receiving entity SHALL consider a transport as finished when Fragment Data has been received which fully covers the Total Length of the transfer.

          <t>
A receiving entity SHALL discard any Transfer item containing different CBOR types than defined in this document.
A receiving entity SHALL discard any Transfer item containing a fragment with an overlapping span.
Because there is no feedback indication at the UDPCL layer, a transmitter has no indication when a transfer is discarded by the receiver.

A receiving entity SHOULD discard unfinished transfer state after an implementation-defined timeout since the last received fragment.
Entities SHOULD choose a transfer timeout interval no longer than one minute (60 seconds).
Discarding an unfinished transfer causes no indication to the transmitting entity, but does indicate this to the BP agent.
This timeout is purely receiver-side and represents the maximum allowed time between sequential received datagrams (in any order), which should be short if the datagrams take a similar network path.

The function and mechanism of DTLS authentication in UDPCL is the same as for TLS in TCPCL as defined in <xref section="4.4.4" target="I-D.ietf-dtn-tcpclv4"/>, with the exception that Node ID Authentication is based on an optional Sender Node ID extension (see <xref target="sec-ext-sender-nodeid"/>) used to disambiguate when an end-entity certificate contains multiple NODE-ID values.

They are restated in this document for clarity.
        </t>
          <t>
A RECOMMENDED security policy is to enable the use of OCSP checking during DTLS handshake.
A RECOMMENDED security policy is that if an Extended Key Usage is present that it needs to contain "id-kp-bundleSecurity" of <xref target="IANA-SMI"/> to be usable with UDPCL security.
A RECOMMENDED security policy is to require a validated NODE-ID and to ignore any network-level DNS-ID or IPADDR-ID.
        </t>
          <t>
This policy relies on and informs the certificate requirements in <xref target="sec-udpcl-cert-profile"/>.
This policy assumes that a DTN-aware CA (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>) will only issue a certificate for a Node ID when it has verified that the private key holder actually controls the DTN node; this is needed to avoid the threat identified in <xref target="sec-threat-node-impersonation"/>.
This policy requires that a certificate contain a NODE-ID and allows the certificate to also contain network-level identifiers.
A tailored policy on a more controlled network could relax the requirement on Node ID validation and allow just network-level identifiers to authenticate a peer.

          <name>Example Secured and Return-Path Transfers</name>

This simple example shows a sequence of pre-transfer setup followed by a set of (unrelated) bundle transfers.
All messaging in this example occurs between the same Entity A address-and-port and Entity B address-and-port.
          </t>
          <t>
The example Entity A has a policy to only send or receive bundles within a DTLS session, so any outgoing bundles to Entity B are queued until the DTLS session is established.
Because Entity A is willing to accept transfers on its ephemeral UDP port, the first outgoing message after the DTLS handshake contains the Sender Listen extension (along with a Sender Node ID indicating its identity to Entity B).

This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref target="RFC7942"/>.
The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations can exist.
      </t>
      <t>
An example implementation of the this draft of UDPCL has been created as a GitHub project <xref target="github-dtn-demo-agent"/> and is intended to use as a proof-of-concept and as a possible source of interoperability testing.
This example implementation uses D-Bus as the CL-BP Agent interface, so it only runs on hosts which provide the Python "dbus" library.

This section separates security considerations into threat categories based on guidance of BCP 72 <xref target="RFC3552"/>.
      </t>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Passive Leak of Node Data</name>
        <t>
When used without DTLS security, the UDPCL can expose the Node ID and other configuration data to passive eavesdroppers.
This can occur even if no bundle transfers are transmitted.
This can be avoided by always using DTLS, even if authentication is not available (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsalt"/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Passive Leak of Bundle Data</name>
        <t>
UDPCL can be used to provide point-to-point unicast transport security, but does not provide multicast security, security of data-at-rest, and does not guarantee end-to-end bundle security.
In those cases the bundle security mechanisms defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec"/> are to be used instead.
        </t>
        <t>
When used without DTLS security, the UDPCL exposes all bundle data to passive eavesdroppers.
This can be avoided by always using DTLS for unicast messaging, even if authentication is not available (see <xref target="sec-security-tlsalt"/>).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-tls-strip">
        <name>Threat: Transport Security Stripping</name>
        <t>
When security policy allows non-DTLS messaging, UDPCL does not protect against active network attackers.
It is possible for a on-path attacker to drop or alter packets containing Extension Map and/or DTLS handshake records, which will cause the receiver to not negotiate a DTLS session.
This leads to the "SSL Stripping" attack described in <xref target="RFC7457"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
When DTLS is available on an entity, it is strongly encouraged that the security policy disallow non-DTLS messaging for unicast purposes.
This requires that the DTLS handshake occurs before any other UDPCL messaging, regardless of the policy-driven parameters of the handshake and policy-driven handling of the handshake outcome.
        </t>
        <t>
One mechanism to mitigate the possibility of DTLS stripping is the use of DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) <xref target="RFC6698"/> toward the passive peer.
This mechanism relies on DNS and is unidirectional, so it doesn't help with applying policy toward the active peer, but it can be useful in an environment using opportunistic security.
The configuration and use of DANE are outside of the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
The negotiated use of DTLS is identical behavior to STARTTLS use in <xref target="RFC2595"/>, <xref target="RFC4511"/>, and others.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Weak DTLS Configurations</name>
        <t>
Even when using DTLS to secure the UDPCL session, the actual ciphersuite negotiated between the DTLS peers can be insecure.
Recommendations for ciphersuite use are included in BCP 195 <xref target="RFC7525"/>.
It is up to security policies within each UDPCL entity to ensure that the negotiated DTLS ciphersuite meets transport security requirements.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-untrust-cert">
        <name>Threat: Untrusted End-Entity Certificate</name>
        <t>
The profile in <xref target="sec-dtls-authentication"/> uses end-entity certificates chained up to a trusted root CA.
During DTLS handshake, either entity can send a certificate set which does not contain the full chain, possibly excluding intermediate or root CAs.
In an environment where peers are known to already contain needed root and intermediate CAs there is no need to include those CAs, but this has a risk of an entity not actually having one of the needed CAs.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Certificate Validation Vulnerabilities</name>
        <t>
Even when DTLS itself is operating properly an attacker can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities within certificate check algorithms or configuration to establish a secure DTLS session using an invalid certificate.
An invalid certificate exploit could lead to bundle data leaking and/or denial of service to the Node ID being impersonated.
        </t>
        <t>
There are many reasons, described in <xref target="RFC5280"/> and <xref target="RFC6125"/>, why a certificate can fail to validate, including using the certificate outside of its valid time interval, using purposes for which it was not authorized, or using it after it has been revoked by its CA.
Validating a certificate is a complex task and can require network connectivity outside of the primary UDPCL network path(s) if a mechanism such as OCSP <xref target="RFC6960"/> is used by the CA.
The configuration and use of particular certificate validation methods are outside of the scope of this document.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sec-threat-node-impersonation">
        <name>Threat: BP Node Impersonation</name>
        <t>
The certificates exchanged by DTLS enable authentication of peer DNS name and Node ID, but it is possible that a peer either not provide a valid certificate or that the certificate does not validate either the DNS-ID/IPADDR-ID or NODE-ID of the peer (see <xref target="sec-pkix-env"/>).
Having a CA-validated certificate does not alone guarantee the identity of the network host or BP node from which the certificate is provided; additional validation procedures in <xref target="sec-dtls-handshake"/> bind the DNS-ID/IPADDR-ID or NODE-ID based on the contents of the certificate.
        </t>
        <t>
The DNS-ID/IPADDR-ID validation is a weaker form of authentication, because even if a peer is operating on an authenticated network DNS name or IP address it can provide an invalid Node ID and cause bundles to be "leaked" to an invalid node.
Especially in DTN environments, network names and addresses of nodes can be time-variable so binding a certificate to a Node ID is a more stable identity.
        </t>
        <t>
NODE-ID validation ensures that the peer to which a bundle is transferred is in fact the node which the BP Agent expects it to be.
In circumstances where certificates can only be issued to DNS names, Node ID validation is not possible but it could be reasonable to assume that a trusted host is not going to present an invalid Node ID.
Determining when a DNS-ID/IPADDR-ID authentication can be trusted to validate a Node ID is also a policy matter outside of the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
One mitigation to arbitrary entities with valid PKIX certificates impersonating arbitrary Node IDs is the use of the PKIX Extended Key Usage key purpose "id-kp-bundleSecurity" of <xref target="IANA-SMI"/>.
When this Extended Key Usage is present in the certificate, it represents a stronger assertion that the private key holder should in fact be trusted to operate as a DTN Node.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section>
        <name>Threat: Denial of Service</name>
        <t>
The behaviors described in this section all amount to a potential denial-of-service to a UDPCL entity.
The denial-of-service could be limited to an individual UDPCL entity, or could affect all entities on a host or network segment.
        </t>
        <t>
An entity can send a large amount of data to a UDPCL entity, requiring the receiving entity to handle the data.
The victim entity can block UDP packets from network peers which are thought to be incorrectly behaving within network.
        </t>
        <t>
An entity can also send only one fragment of a seemingly valid transfer and never send the remaining fragments, which will cause resources on the receiver to be wasted on transfer reassembly state.
The victim entity can either block packets from network peers or intentionally keep a short unfinished transfer timeout (see <xref target="sec-transfer-fragmentation"/>).
        </t>
        <t>
The keepalive mechanism can be abused to waste throughput within a network link which would otherwise be usable for bundle transmissions.

        <name>Mandatory-to-Implement DTLS</name>
        <t>
Following IETF best current practice, DTLS is mandatory to implement for all UDPCL implementations but DTLS is optional to use for a any given transfer.
The recommended configuration of <xref target="sec-ext-starttls"/> is to always attempt DTLS, but entities are permitted to disable DTLS based on local configuration.
The configuration to enable or disable DTLS for an entity or a session is outside of the scope of this document.
The configuration to disable DTLS is different from the threat of DTLS stripping described in <xref target="sec-threat-tls-strip"/>.

        <name>Alternate Uses of DTLS</name>

This specification makes use of PKIX certificate validation and authentication within DTLS.
There are alternate uses of DTLS which are not necessarily incompatible with the security goals of this specification, but are outside of the scope of this document.
The following subsections give examples of alternate DTLS uses.
        </t>
        <section anchor="sec-security-tlsnoauth">
          <name>DTLS Without Authentication</name>
          <t> In environments where PKI is available but there are restrictions on the issuance of certificates (including the contents of certificates), it may be possible to make use of DTLS in a way which authenticates only the passive entity of a UDPCL transfer or which does not authenticate either entity.
Using DTLS in a way which does not successfully authenticate some claim of both peer entities of a UDPCL transfer is outside of the scope of this document but does have similar properties to the opportunistic security model of <xref target="RFC7435"/>.

        <section anchor="sec-security-tlsnopki">
          <name>Non-Certificate DTLS Use</name>
          <t>
In environments where PKI is unavailable, alternate uses of DTLS which do not require certificates such as pre-shared key (PSK) authentication <xref target="RFC5489"/> and the use of raw public keys <xref target="RFC7250"/> are available and can be used to ensure confidentiality within UDPCL.
Using non-PKI node authentication methods is outside of the scope of this document.

      <section anchor="sec-security-xferid">
        <name>Predictability of Transfer IDs</name>
        <t>
The only requirement on Transfer IDs is that they are unique from the transmitting peer only.
The trivial algorithm of the first transfer starting at zero and later transfers incrementing by one causes absolutely predictable Transfer IDs.
Even when UDPCL is not DTLS secured and there is a on-path attacker altering UDPCL messages, there is no UDPCL feedback mechanism to interrupt or refuse a transfer so there is no benefit in having unpredictable Transfer IDs.
